an open-source orchestration library that helps developers connection LLMs for building complex applications_

It provides a standard interface for various components and abstractions:  

- `LLMs`: The backbone of LangChain, LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT-3 or GPT-4 provide the core capabilities for understanding and generating language. They are trained on vast datasets to produce coherent and contextually relevant text.
- `Prompt Templates`: These templates structure the input to LLMs, maximizing their effectiveness in understanding and responding to queries. By designing effective prompts, developers can guide the LLMs to produce desired outputs.
- `Output Parsers`: These components refine the language generated by LLMs into formats that are useful and relevant to specific tasks, enhancing the overall user experience.
- `Vector Store`: This component handles the embedding of words or phrases into numerical vectors, which is essential for tasks involving semantic analysis and understanding language nuances.
- `Agents`**:** Agents are decision-making components that determine the best course of action based on input, context, and available resources. They enable LLMs to interact intelligently with their environment.

## Chain

Chain of Thought (CoT), the implementation on minimum manageable steps  

- explicitly guiding the LLM to think step-by-step through a problem
- split the overall task into subtasks and run the subtasks sequentially
- the output of one step becomes the input of the next

# LangGraph

LangGraph is an extension of LangChain that focuses on building more complex and controllable agent workflows using a graph-based approach  

## LangChain vs LangGraph (DAG vs Graph)

Key components:  

- `State`: A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application.
- `Nodes`: Python functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current `State` as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated `State`.
- `Edges`: Python functions that determine which `Node` to execute next based on the current `State`. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions.

  
Support cases such as time travel/human in the loop/parallelization/multi agents(stateful) architecture  

## Deciding Between LangChain and OpenAI API

### Use Direct API (such as OpenAI) When:

- Simplicity and performance are top priorities.
- Tasks are straightforward and don’t require chaining operations.

- Answering single-turn questions
- Running one-off analyses
- Performance-critical applications

### Use LangChain When:

- You need to chain multiple operations conveniently.
- Development speed and maintainability are important.
- Your project involves integrating tools, external APIs, or maintaining state across interactions.

- Ease of Chaining Tasks: You can easily combine multiple operations (e.g., answering questions based on external data).
- Built-in Tools and Agents: LangChain offers agents to manage complex workflows with minimal code.
- Extensibility: It integrates with external systems like document stores, APIs, and Python functions.
